Perksy was designed to address the respondent experience first through an immersive mobile solution.

With Perksy, it’s all about the experience. It's that patented mobile experience that brings us response rates upwards of 80%.

Our patented design of image-rich screens help survey takers relate to the content, which creates a more immersive survey.

A better experience leads to more engagement and responses. Better
responses lead to better data and more in-depth, actionable insights
you can count on.

## Surveys Reimagined

Our interactive and immersive mobile-first experience is designed
especially for the consumer – with response rates over 40x the
competition.

* Mobile-First: We collect insights through the Perksy app, where
users answer interactive, content-rich questions called “stacks”
(our word for survey).

* Rewarding: Users earn points for each stack and can redeem at 100+
brands in our Perkstore – like Delta, Amazon, Nordstrom, Sephora,
and Uber.
